    "text": "This guide is a compilation of many tools scripts, pieces of code and routines that I used during my PhD. As the name says, everything goes around assimilating observations using the GSI system. I spent a lot of time working with the conventional and Radiance observations so you will find a comprehensive tutorial and documentation on how to assimilate these types of observations. This includes the processing of the observations, how to configure the system and all the quality control steps GSI performs during the assimilation process.\nSometimes you will find everything inside the website and sometimes you will need to go to a specific repository to get the code or the data associated with the the specific topic. And while I tried to be mindful during my PhD at commenting and documenting everything along the way I’m sure that there are gaps and missing pieces. If you find anything that can be improved please open an issue in the repository of this website and contribute to making this guide better.\nMany of these tools come from different sources. Sometimes someone else wrote the code and I adapted it to my specific needs, sometimes I wrote the code from scratch. So it’s important to read the license note in each section so you know who created that code and in which way you can use it."

It focus on the use of GSI as a observation operator along with the LETKF version. It covers everything you need from how to deal with observations (in bufr format), how to configure the system to how read and interpret GSI outputs."
