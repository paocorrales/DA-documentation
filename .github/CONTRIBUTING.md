# Contributing to DA-documentation

This outlines how to propose a change to DA-documentation.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the *source* file. This will automatically open a pull request

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue to start a conversation.

### Pull request process

To open a pull request you'll need to fork the repository. This website is builded with quarto, make sure you have it installed if you want to build the website locally to test the chances you are proposing.
